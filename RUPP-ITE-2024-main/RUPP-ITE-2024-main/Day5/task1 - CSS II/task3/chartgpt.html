What is Sass?
Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS by allowing features such as variables, nesting, inheritance, partials, and more. It helps in writing more maintainable, reusable, and modular CSS code.

Differences Between Sass and Regular CSS:
Nesting: Sass allows you to nest selectors inside one another, following the structure of your HTML, which simplifies CSS organization.
Variables: Sass allows the use of variables to store values (like colors, fonts, etc.) and reuse them throughout the stylesheet.
Partials and Imports: You can break your CSS into smaller, manageable pieces using partials and import them into a main file.
Mixins: Sass provides reusable chunks of CSS with mixins.
Increased Readability: Sass files are often easier to read and maintain than pure CSS files because of its features like nesting and variables.
// _variables.scss (This is a partial file)
$primary-color: #3498db;
$secondary-color: #2ecc71;
$font-stack: 'Arial', sans-serif;

// _header.scss (This is another partial file)
.header {
    background-color: $primary-color;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
    
    h1 {
        font-family: $font-stack;
        font-size: 2em;
    }
    
    nav {
        ul {
            list-style: none;
            
            li {
                display: inline-block;
                margin-right: 10px;
                
                a {
                    color: white;
                    text-decoration: none;
                    
                    &:hover {
                        color: $secondary-color;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// main.scss (The main Sass file that imports partials)
@import 'variables';
@import 'header';

body {
    font-family: $font-stack;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}
Nesting:
Inside .header, the h1, nav, ul, li, and a elements are nested, which mimics the HTML structure, making the styles more intuitive.
Partials:
_variables.scss and _header.scss are partials. These files are imported into main.scss using the @import directive. Partials are denoted by an underscore (_), and they are not compiled into standalone CSS files, making it easier to manage your code.
Imports:
The @import directive in main.scss brings in the styles from _variables.scss and _header.scss into the main file, allowing you to split your CSS into modules and keep it organized.
Compiled CSS (After Sass Compilation)
When you compile styles.scss using a Sass compiler (like sass command line tool or build tools like Webpack, Gulp), the output CSS file might look like this:
/* Compiled CSS */

/* From _variables.scss */
body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

/* From _header.scss */
.header {
    background-color: #3498db;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
}

.header h1 {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    font-size: 2em;
}

.header nav ul {
    list-style: none;
}

.header nav ul li {
    display: inline-block;
    margin-right: 10px;
}

.header nav ul li a {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
}

.header nav ul li a:hover {
    color: #2ecc71;
}
