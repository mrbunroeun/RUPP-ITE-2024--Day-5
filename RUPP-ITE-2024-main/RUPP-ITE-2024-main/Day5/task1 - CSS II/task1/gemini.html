A CSS processor is a tool that extends the capabilities of CSS by adding new features and syntax. These processors compile your extended CSS code into standard CSS that can be understood by browsers. This process is often referred to as CSS preprocessing.

Popular CSS Preprocessors
Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets): One of the most widely used preprocessors, offering features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions.
Less (Leaner CSS): Similar to Sass, Less provides features like variables, mixins, and nesting.
Stylus (A dynamic CSS language): Stylus offers a more expressive syntax and features like interpolation and conditionals.
Advantages of Using a CSS Processor
Improved Maintainability: CSS processors allow you to organize your CSS code better using features like variables, nesting, and mixins, making it easier to manage and update.
Enhanced Reusability: Mixins and functions enable you to create reusable code blocks, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.
Time-Saving Features: Features like nesting and variables can save you time by reducing the amount of code you need to write.
Advanced Features: CSS processors often provide features like color manipulation, unit conversion, and browser-specific prefixes, simplifying complex CSS tasks.
