Here is a complete code snippet that demonstrates how to implement a theme switcher using Sass and variables:

SCSS
// Define the variables for the light and dark themes
$light-primary-color: #ffffff;
$light-secondary-color: #f5f5f5;
$light-accent-color: #007bff;
$dark-primary-color: #121212;
$dark-secondary-color: #212121;
$dark-accent-color: #ff5722;

// Create a function that returns the appropriate theme color based on the current value of the `theme` variable
@function get-theme-color($color-name) {
  @if ($theme == 'light') {
    @return map-get($light-colors, $color-name);
  }
  @else {
    @return map-get($dark-colors, $color-name);
  }
}

// Create a function that toggles the theme between light and dark
@function toggle-theme() {
  @if ($theme == 'light') {
    $theme: 'dark';
  }
  @else {
    $theme: 'light';
  }
}

// Create the light and dark theme maps
$light-colors: (
  primary: $light-primary-color,
  secondary: $light-secondary-color,
  accent: $light-accent-color,
);
$dark-colors: (
  primary: $dark-primary-color,
  secondary: $dark-secondary-color,
  accent: $dark-accent-color,
);

// Create the theme switcher button
<button class="theme-switcher" onclick="toggle-theme()">
  <span class="theme-switcher-text">Toggle Theme</span>
</button>

// Apply the theme colors to the body and other elements
body {
  background-color: get-theme-color('primary');
}

h1, h2, h3 {
  color: get-theme-color('accent');
}

p {
  color: get-theme-color('secondary');
}
Use code with caution.

In this example, we first define the variables for the light and dark themes. We then create a function that returns the appropriate theme color based on the current value of the theme variable. This function is used to apply the theme colors to the body and other elements of the page. We also create a theme switcher button that allows users to toggle between the light and dark themes.

Here are some additional points to note:

The theme variable can be set to either "light" or "dark" based on the user's preference.
The get-theme-color function uses the map-get function to retrieve the appropriate color from the light or dark theme map.
The toggle-theme function simply toggles the value of the theme variable between "light" and "dark".
The theme switcher button can be styled in any way you like. In the example above, we have added a simple text label and a background color that changes based on the current theme.
You can use the get-theme-color function to apply the theme colors to any element on your page. For example, you could use it to change the background color of a button or the color of a text element.
This is just a simple example of how to implement a theme switcher using Sass. You can customize it to fit your own needs and preferences.

Here are some additional tips for using Sass to create themes:

Use descriptive variable names. This will make your code easier to read and understand.
Group your theme variables together. This will help you keep your code organized and make it easier to maintain.
Use a consistent naming convention for your theme variables. This will make it easier to remember which variables you need to use.
Use a CSS preprocessor that supports Sass. There are many different CSS preprocessors available, but not all of them support Sass. Make sure you choose a preprocessor that is compatible with Sass.
Test your theme switcher on different devices and browsers. This will help you ensure that it works correctly on all platforms.
By following these tips, you can create beautiful and functional themes using Sass.
