Bootstrap Framework:

Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework that provides a collection of pre-styled components, such as buttons, forms, grids, and navigation bars, to help developers create responsive and visually appealing web pages. It is designed to be mobile-first, meaning that it prioritizes the user experience on small screens and adapts seamlessly to larger screens.

How Bootstrap Helps in Developing Responsive Web Designs:

Bootstrap provides a number of features that make it easy to develop responsive web designs:

Grid System: Bootstrap's grid system is based on a 12-column layout and is designed to be responsive. This means that the layout will adjust itself to fit the width of the device that the page is being viewed on.
Responsive Components: Many of Bootstrap's components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars, are designed to be responsive. This means that they will also adjust themselves to fit the width of the device that the page is being viewed on.
Utility Classes: Bootstrap provides a number of utility classes that can be used to add custom styles to elements. These utility classes are also responsive, meaning that they will adjust themselves to fit the width of the device that the page is being viewed on.
