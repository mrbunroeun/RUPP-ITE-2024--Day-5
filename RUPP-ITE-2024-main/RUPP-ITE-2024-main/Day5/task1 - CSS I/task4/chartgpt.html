CSS issues can arise from a variety of causes, including incorrect selectors, conflicting styles, or unexpected inheritance. Debugging CSS effectively involves identifying and resolving issues by inspecting how styles are applied to HTML elements. Browser developer tools are the primary resource for debugging CSS, allowing you to inspect, modify, and test CSS rules live without modifying your source code directly.

Common CSS Issues:
Styles Not Applied:
The expected styles are not reflected on the element, often due to specificity issues or incorrect selectors.

Incorrect Layout or Alignment:
Elements may not be positioned as expected due to problems with margins, padding, or floats.

Conflicting Styles:
Multiple styles targeting the same element may override each other unexpectedly.

Box Model Issues:
Elements may not appear at the correct size due to misunderstanding the content-box vs. border-box model.

Responsive Design Problems:
Media queries or flexible layouts may not adapt correctly on different screen sizes.
