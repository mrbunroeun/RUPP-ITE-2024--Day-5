In CSS, colors and backgrounds are used to style elements in various ways, allowing you to set colors for text, borders, and backgrounds as well as apply gradient effects or images as backgrounds.

Applying Colors in CSS:
Hexadecimal (Hex): A color code that starts with a # followed by 3 or 6 hexadecimal digits (e.g., #FF5733 or #F60).
RGB (Red, Green, Blue): A function where colors are defined by specifying the intensity of red, green, and blue between 0 and 255 (e.g., rgb(255, 87, 51)).
HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness): Colors are represented by the hue (angle on the color wheel, 0 to 360), saturation (percentage), and lightness (percentage) (e.g., hsl(15, 100%, 60%)).
Background Properties in CSS:
Background Color: You can set a solid color for the background using color values.
Background Gradient: Gradients allow you to transition between colors either linearly or radially.
Background Image: An image can be used as the background, with options to control its size, repeat pattern, and position.
