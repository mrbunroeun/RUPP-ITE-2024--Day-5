Online fonts, also known as web fonts, are font files that are hosted on a remote server and can be accessed by a website. This eliminates the need to embed font files directly into the HTML code, making it easier to manage and maintain fonts across multiple pages.

Integrating Online Fonts into a Website
To integrate online fonts into a website, you typically use a CSS rule called @font-face. This rule allows you to specify the font family name, the source URL of the font file, and other font properties.

Example using Google Fonts:

Choose a font: Visit the Google Fonts website (fonts.google.com) and select the desired font.
Embed the CSS code: Copy the provided CSS code and paste it into your website's <head> section.
Use the font: Refer to the font family name in your CSS styles to apply it to text


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,700" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <p>This text uses the Roboto font.</p>
</body>
