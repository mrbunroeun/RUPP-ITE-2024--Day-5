Online fonts are web-hosted fonts that can be easily integrated into websites via a URL, eliminating the need to install fonts locally on a userâ€™s device. They are typically served from a font library or CDN (Content Delivery Network). The most popular example is Google Fonts, which offers a wide range of free fonts.

Using online fonts is advantageous because they provide consistency across devices and browsers, improve performance by utilizing optimized delivery, and offer design flexibility with easy-to-use font variations.
