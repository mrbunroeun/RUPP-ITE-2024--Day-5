In web development, both tables and <div> elements can be used to present content, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases.

    Tables
    Tables are primarily used to display tabular data, meaning data that is organized in rows and columns. They provide a semantic way to present structured information, making it easier for users and search engines to understand the content.
    
    <div> Elements
    The <div> element is a generic container that has no inherent meaning. It is often used for layout purposes, allowing developers to group content and apply styles with CSS. <div> elements are more flexible than tables for designing complex layouts, particularly with CSS Grid and Flexbox.
    
    When to Use Each
    Use tables when:
    
    You need to display tabular data (e.g., schedules, comparisons).
    Semantic markup is important for accessibility and SEO.
    Use <div> elements when:
    
    You are designing a page layout.
    You need to group elements for styling and scripting purposes.
    You want to take advantage of modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox or Grid.
