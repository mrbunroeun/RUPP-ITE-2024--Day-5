What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a 
language used to describe the presentation
 of a webpage, including colors, fonts,
 layout, and overall visual styling. It
  controls how HTML elements are displayed 
  on the screen, making websites more visually 
  appealing and user-friendly.

In web development, CSS plays a crucial role 
in separating content (HTML) from design (CSS).
 It allows developers to:

Control the layout and appearance of multiple webpages at once.
Improve the user experience by adding visual appeal and responsiveness.
Maintain clean code by separating structure (HTML) from design (CSS).
