The CSS box model is a conceptual representation of how elements are rendered on a webpage. It consists of four main components:

Content: The actual content of the element, such as text or images.
Padding: The space between the content and the border.
Border: The outline that surrounds the content and padding.
Margin: The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.
