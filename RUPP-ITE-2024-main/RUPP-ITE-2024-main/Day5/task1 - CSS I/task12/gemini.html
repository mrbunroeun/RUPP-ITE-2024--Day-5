lexbox is a CSS layout module designed to provide a more efficient way to arrange items in a container. It's particularly useful for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

Key Concepts:

Flex Container: The parent element that contains flex items.
Flex Item: The child elements within the flex container.
Flex Axis: The direction in which flex items are placed. It can be horizontal (row) or vertical (column).
Cross Axis: The axis perpendicular to the flex axis.
How Flexbox Simplifies Responsive Design:

Flexible Item Sizing: Flex items can expand or shrink to fill available space, ensuring they fit the container's dimensions.
Alignment Control: Properties like justify-content, align-items, and align-content allow for precise control over the alignment of flex items within the container.
Direction Flexibility: The flex-direction property can easily switch between row and column layouts, making it adaptable to different screen orientations.  


<div class="container">
    <div class="item">Item 1</div>
    <div class="item">Item 2</div>
    <div class="item">Item 3</div>
  </div>



  .container {
    display: flex; /* Makes the container a flex container */
    justify-content: space-between; /* Spaces items evenly */
    align-items: center; /* Centers items vertically */
  }
  
  .item {
    flex: 1; /* Gives each item equal flexibility to grow or shrink */
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
  }
