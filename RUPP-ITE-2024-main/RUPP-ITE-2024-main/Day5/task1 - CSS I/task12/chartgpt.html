Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model designed to enable responsive web design more efficiently. It allows for the arrangement of items in a one-dimensional space, either as a row or a column. Flexbox is particularly useful for creating fluid layouts that adapt to varying screen sizes, making it an essential tool for modern web development.
